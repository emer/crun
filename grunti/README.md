# grunti

`grunti` is a GUI interface to the grunt client, providing table views of jobs in the different status (pending, running, done), and actions performed on selected jobs.

# todo:

* table view selection for inactive table only supports single-select -- need a mode switch there to allow multi-select in inactive mode.  This must also support selecting *nothing* which should be the default.  and in inactive mode, it is not properly updating SelectedIdxs.
